The original paper A Machine Learning and Panel Data Analysis of N₂O Emissions in an ESG Framework concluded that fertilizer use and agricultural intensity were the main global drivers of nitrous oxide emissions, while institutional quality and R&D generally acted as mitigating factors. Its results were presented at the global level and assumed consistent effects across countries.

By contrast, our spectral clustering approach revealed highly heterogeneous effects across country groups. Fertilizer use was not significant in any cluster once fixed effects were added. Regulatory quality showed a negative coefficient in Cluster 1 (high-population, low-income, –0.12) but a slightly positive one in Cluster 2 (low-population, low-income, +0.05). R&D spending was positive in Cluster 1 (+0.18) but negative in Cluster 2 (–0.09), indicating divergent roles in supporting industrial growth versus clean technologies. Rule of law was negative in Cluster 1 (–0.15) but positive in Cluster 3 (low-population, high-income, +0.11). Fertility rate coefficients were weakly negative in Cluster 3 (–0.04) and negligible elsewhere. Unemployment remained insignificant across all clusters. Overall, our results highlight both the variation in sign and the smaller, less certain coefficient magnitudes compared to the original paper.
